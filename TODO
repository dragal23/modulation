Fix psk::split so it handles bauds which don't divide 8! Should this
handle larger wirds as well?

Modify psk::generator to return a signal class which includes the I
and Q waves as well as the modulated signal!

Find betterway to allow lookup of predifined constellations!

Also constillations should have there own class which gives info like
baud rate etc.
