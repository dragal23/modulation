This is a collection of libraries dealing with modulation
techniques. They were written to aid learning and to explore the
science of modulation.

The current way of dealling with contellations (ie definitions of the
modulation scheme) is a bit squiffy. At present the class
constellaitions_ allows lookup on these and needs be be instantiated
by the user. This works, but is a bit naff. I will investigate
alternatives!
